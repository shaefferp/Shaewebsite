             <p>We assist developers in areas designated as underserved and distressed communities. 
                 This encourages investors to develop these areas and provide new jobs,
                 economic growth, and stimulates expansion in the communities being served.
                 
            </p>
                 <p class=halfp>We are a Public Benefits Corporation registered in Texas
                     and our market areas incude primarily Texas and Oklahoma at this time. 
                     In addition to serving distressed communities our goal is to invest
                     our profits to provide growth in artistic, charitable, cultural, economic,
                     literary, medical, religious, scientific, or technological areas 
                     in underserved communities to create a better quality of life.
                     We will focus on assisting veterans and many others that are in need of aid.
                                         </p>
      
        
        
             <p>We are also the home of the trademarked "SMART Park" ,
                 which stands for Sustainable Manufacturibg Agricultural Renewable Technology Park.
                 Think conceptually of combining agriculture,
                 manufacturing and recycling together with the goal of 
                 maximum efficiency and minimal or no waste. Add in the
                 Eco friendly renewable and alternative power sources supplied by wind, biofuels,
                 solar or possibly even hydrogen power. Next realize that
                 you have created an a sustainable project managed and funded through the creation of an agricultural district 
                 district to house all this.  (ask us how)                 </p>
                 <p>You now have a profitable business unit, with zero waste, 
                 great profits, tax revenue, and possibly "Tax Credits" and "Renewable Energy
                 Credits" from the government. You also now have created 
                 jobs, and are providing quality products to your local
                 community, within 200 miles. Wow? It's a big deal right?</p>
         


      
<h1> Ecologically Sustainable SMART Parks</h1>
     
 
 
     
 
      
             <p>When you create a SMART Park, you now have a profitable
                business unit, with minimal or zero waste, great profits, and potentially
                 tax revenues in different types of government sponsored opprtunities.
                  You also now have created jobs, and are providing quality products to your local
                 community, within up to a 200 mileradius. We are here to help you every inch 
                 of the way providing consulting support for design, financing, implementation or expansion.
                 Our fee structure ties our success to your success.
            </p>
                 <p>One option in a SMART Park scenario might be to add into an agricuture/ farming model
                     an Aquapoenics tank and raise fast growing fish like Tilapia.
                     They are good both for food and fertilizer production. These are just a
                     few of the many opportunities we have in place to make a SMART Park 
                     verstaile and profitable in a short period of time. </p>
